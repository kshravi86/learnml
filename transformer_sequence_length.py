This file demonstrates how Transformers handle sequence length limitations.

Transformers have a fixed maximum sequence length, which is typically set to 512 or 1024 tokens.
This limitation is due to the self-attention mechanism, which has a computational complexity of O(n^2) where n is the sequence length.

To handle longer sequences, several techniques can be used:

1. Truncation: truncate the sequence to the maximum allowed length
2. Chunking: split the sequence into smaller chunks and process each chunk separately
3. Hierarchical processing: process the sequence in a hierarchical manner, using a combination of local and global attention mechanisms

Here is an example of how to use the Hugging Face Transformers library to process a long sequence:
"""

import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

# Load a pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Define a long sequence
long_sequence = "This is a very long sequence that exceeds the maximum sequence length of 512 tokens."

# Truncate the sequence to the maximum allowed length
max_length = 512
truncated_sequence = long_sequence[:max_length]

# Tokenize the sequence
inputs = tokenizer(truncated_sequence, return_tensors="pt")

# Process the sequence using the model
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Print the output
print(outputs.last_hidden_state.shape)
